2. Transition Phase - smooth handoff to visual views
3. Visualization Phase - focused data presentation
4. Return Phase - easy return to conversation

### Hybrid Components
1. Inline charts and graphs within conversation
2. Expandable visualization elements
3. Interactive data annotations

## Integration Points

### Spartan Interface API
- **View Controller Integration**: Standardized methods for opening Spartan views
- **Data Synchronization**: Real-time data updates between Chat Maestro and Spartan modules
- **Event Handling**: Capture user interactions with visual elements

### Conversation System
- **Context Analysis**: Integration with conversation context management
- **Message Processing**: Real-time analysis of user messages for redirection triggers
- **State Management**: Coordinated state between conversation and visualization

### User Experience
- **Seamless Transitions**: Smooth navigation between conversation and visualization
- **Context Preservation**: Maintaining conversation thread across view changes
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear paths between views with easy return options

## Next Steps

### 1. Spartan Interface Integration

- Develop context-aware redirection suggestions

### 3. Hybrid View Implementation
- Create inline visualization components
- Implement expandable data elements
- Add interactive annotations that trigger conversational responses

### 4. Real-world Testing
- Deploy with a small group of users
- Monitor navigation patterns and user preferences
- Gather feedback on transition smoothness and utility

### 5. Performance Optimization
- Implement lazy loading for visualization components
- Optimize data transmission between systems
- Add caching for frequently accessed views

### 6. Voice Command Integration
- Extend trigger recognition to voice commands
- Implement voice-based navigation
- Add voice feedback during view transitions

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement

## Technical Implementation Details

### Predictive Algorithms
The system uses weighted algorithms to calculate projections:
- **Training Effect** (50% weight): Based on training adherence and fitness level
- **Nutrition Effect** (30% weight): Based on nutrition adherence and current body composition
- **Recovery Effect** (20% weight): Based on sleep quality and stress management

### Data Models
The system uses the following data models:
- **BiometricData**: Weight, body fat percentage, muscle mass, bone density, heart rate metrics, blood pressure, VO2 max, glucose, and cholesterol
- **AdherenceMetrics**: Training adherence, nutrition adherence, sleep quality, supplementation adherence, and stress management
- **EvolutionProjection**: Timeframe-specific projections for strength, muscle mass, and body composition
- **PredictiveInsights**: Complete set of projections, risk factors, optimization opportunities, and recommendations

### UI Components
The dashboard includes:
- Timeframe selector (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year)
- Confidence indicator with progress bar
- Strength projections cards for key lifts
- Muscle mass projections display
- Body composition changes visualization
- Key factors influencing projections
- Risk factors identification
- Optimization opportunities suggestions
- Personalized recommendations
- Summary table comparing all timeframes

## Integration Points
1. **Navigation**: Accessible from the main dashboard via a dedicated card
2. **Data Flow**: Uses existing user data structures and passes them to the predictive engine
3. **Lazy Loading**: Implemented with React lazy loading for performance optimization
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface using Tailwind CSS

## Testing
- Created unit tests to verify component imports
- Verified that the development server runs correctly with the new features

## Future Enhancements
1. Integration with real biometric data sources
2. Enhanced predictive algorithms with machine learning
3. More detailed visualization of progressions
4. Integration with wearable device data
5. Advanced filtering and comparison options

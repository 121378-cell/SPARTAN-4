# SPARTAN 4 Marketplace - Usage Guide

## Overview

The SPARTAN 4 Marketplace is an AI-powered e-commerce platform that provides personalized recommendations for fitness equipment, clothing, supplements, and services. This guide explains how to use and extend the marketplace system.

## Getting Started

The marketplace is already integrated into the SPARTAN 4 application. Users can access it through the main dashboard.

## Key Features

### 1. Personalized Recommendations

The AI recommendation engine generates personalized product suggestions based on:

- User fitness level
- Training goals
- Preferred training location (gym, home, outdoor)
- Current equipment
- Budget range
- Brand preferences
- Dietary restrictions/allergies

### 2. Product Categories

The marketplace supports four main product categories:

1. **Equipment**: Dumbbells, barbells, machines, accessories, wearables
2. **Clothing**: Tops, bottoms, shoes, accessories
3. **Supplements**: Proteins, pre-workouts, post-workouts, health supplements
4. **Services**: Personal training, nutrition coaching, online programs

### 3. AI Validation

All products are validated by our AI system for:
- Quality
- Authenticity
- Safety
- Effectiveness

Products with high validation scores are marked with a "Validated by AI" badge.

### 4. Shopping Cart

Users can:
- Add products to cart
- Adjust quantities
- View order summary
- Proceed to checkout

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. **Marketplace Types** (`lib/marketplace-types.ts`): Defines all interfaces and types
2. **AI Engine** (`lib/marketplace-ai-engine.ts`): Handles recommendations and product validation
3. **Dashboard** (`components/MarketplaceDashboard.tsx`): User interface component

### Integration Points

The marketplace integrates with:
- User profile data
- Authentication system
- Storage system for cart persistence

## Extending the Marketplace

### Adding New Product Categories

1. Update `ProductCategory` type in `marketplace-types.ts`
2. Add new subcategory types as needed
3. Create specific product interfaces
4. Update the AI engine to handle the new category
5. Update the dashboard UI to display the new category

### Customizing Recommendation Algorithm

The recommendation algorithm scores products based on several factors:
1. Category Match (30 points)
2. Goal Alignment (25 points)
3. Budget Compatibility (20 points)
4. Equipment Gap (15 points)
5. Brand Preference (10 points)
6. AI Validation (10 points)

To modify the scoring:
1. Edit `calculateProductScore` method in `marketplace-ai-engine.ts`
2. Adjust weight values for each factor
3. Update `calculateGoalAlignment` for new goal mappings
4. Modify `generateRecommendationReasons` to add new reason types

### Adding New AI Validation Criteria

To add new validation criteria:
1. Update `AIValidationResult` interface in `marketplace-types.ts`
2. Modify `initializeAIValidations` in `marketplace-ai-engine.ts`
3. Update the dashboard to display new validation information

## Testing

The marketplace includes comprehensive tests:
- Unit tests for the AI engine
- Component import tests
- Integration tests for recommendations

Run tests with:
```bash
npm test -- __tests__/marketplace.test.ts
```

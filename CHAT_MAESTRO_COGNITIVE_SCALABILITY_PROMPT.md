# Chat Maestro Cognitive Scalability Prompt

## Core Concept
Chat Maestro is designed with cognitive scalability as a fundamental principle, enabling the system to grow in knowledge, functions, and specialization without requiring complete system restructuring. The architecture supports modular expansion of competencies while maintaining coherence and performance.

## Scalable Architecture Framework

### Modular Knowledge Base
- **Domain-Specific Modules**: Independent knowledge modules for each specialization (fisioterapia, psicología deportiva, meditación, etc.)

- **Dependency Management**: Clear dependency definitions between modules to prevent conflicts

### Dynamic Competency System
- **Competency Registration**: Standardized interface for registering new competencies
- **Context-Aware Activation**: Competencies automatically activate based on conversation context
- **Priority-Based Selection**: Conflict resolution when multiple competencies apply
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track competency effectiveness and usage patterns

### Extensible Function Framework
- **Function Registry**: Centralized registry for all available functions
- **API Abstraction**: Consistent interfaces for function invocation
- **Resource Management**: Efficient allocation of computational resources to functions
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating even if specific functions are unavailable

## Knowledge Expansion Mechanisms

### Incremental Learning
- **Continuous Integration**: New knowledge can be added without disrupting existing capabilities
- **Validation Pipeline**: Automated testing of new knowledge before integration
- **Rollback Capability**: Quick restoration to previous knowledge states if issues arise

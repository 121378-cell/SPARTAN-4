# SPARTAN 4 Modals

This directory contains the implementation of various modals for the SPARTAN 4 system, including the Advanced "Tarjetas Inteligentes" modal.

## Modal Implementations

### Advanced "Tarjetas Inteligentes" Modal

The Advanced "Tarjetas Inteligentes" modal provides dynamic, adaptive exercise guidance with real-time feedback, intelligent timing, progress tracking, and contextual recommendations.

#### Key Features

1. **Dynamic Exercise Guidance**
   - Real-time form correction with AI-powered movement analysis
   - Load optimization based on performance history
   - Tempo control with precise timing guidance
   - Range of motion tracking for optimal execution

2. **Intelligent Timing System**
   - Adaptive rest periods based on workout intensity and user recovery
   - Superset coordination for seamless exercise transitions
   - Circuit flow management for complex workout sequences
   - Warm-up progression with graduated intensity timing

3. **Progress History Integration**
   - Performance visualization with graphical representation of improvements
   - Volume load tracking for comprehensive training stress monitoring
   - Personal record recognition and automatic milestone celebration
   - Trend analysis for plateau detection and breakthrough opportunities

4. **Variation Recommendation Engine**
   - Muscle group targeting with alternative exercises for specific development
   - Equipment adaptation with substitutions based on available resources
   - Injury prevention with modifications for prehabilitation and rehabilitation
   - Skill progression with advanced variations as user competence increases

5. **Real-Time Feedback System**
   - Biometric integration with heart rate, breathing, and fatigue monitoring
   - Performance metrics with instant analysis of power, velocity, and technique
   - Motivational cues with contextual encouragement based on effort and progress
   - Safety protocols with automatic intervention for form breakdown or overexertion

## Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. UniversalDeviceIntegrationService
The main service that handles all device integration functionality:
- Device registration and management
- Data processing and routing
- Quality metrics tracking
- Statistics monitoring
- Configuration management

#### 2. Type Definitions
Comprehensive type definitions for all device integration components:
- Universal device data structures
- Device connection protocols
- Quality metrics
- Integration configuration
- Statistics tracking

### Key Algorithms

#### Device Data Routing
The service automatically routes incoming device data to the appropriate processing service based on device type:
- Wearable and biometric sensor data → Wearable Integration Service
- Smart equipment data → IoT Integration Service
- Environmental sensor data → IoT Integration Service
- Specialized sensor data (force, EMG, IMU) → Direct to Nervous System
- Camera systems → Direct to Nervous System
- Custom devices → Direct to Nervous System

#### Quality Filtering
Data quality is assessed using multiple metrics:
- Signal strength (0-100)
- Data completeness (0-100)
- Synchronization quality (excellent, good, fair, poor)
- Battery level (0-100, when available)

Data below the configured quality threshold is filtered out to prevent inaccurate analysis.

## Integration Points

### Spartan Nervous System
All processed device data is sent to the Spartan Nervous System for:
- Real-time insights generation
- Alert and recommendation creation
- Cross-module data coordination
- Proactive system behavior

### Existing Services

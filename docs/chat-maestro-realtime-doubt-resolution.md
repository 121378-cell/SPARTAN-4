## Doubt Resolution Framework

### 1. Question Classification System

The system will classify incoming questions into three primary categories:

#### A. Ambiguous Questions
- Questions with unclear intent or multiple possible interpretations
- Examples: "What should I do?", "I'm not feeling well", "Something hurts"

#### B. Technical Questions
- Questions seeking specific information or instructions
- Examples: "How do I perform a deadlift?", "What's the RPE scale?", "How much protein should I eat?"

#### C. Motivational Questions
- Questions seeking encouragement or emotional support
- Examples: "I don't feel motivated", "Should I continue?", "Am I progressing?"

### 2. Response Generation Strategy

#### For Ambiguous Questions:
1. **Clarification Request**: Ask follow-up questions to better understand the user's needs
2. **Context Analysis**: Use available user data to make educated assumptions
3. **Multi-Path Responses**: Provide multiple potential interpretations with corresponding advice
4. **Escalation Protocol**: For complex cases, suggest consulting with a human expert

#### For Technical Questions:
1. **Knowledge Retrieval**: Access relevant information from the integrated knowledge bases
2. **Personalization**: Adapt information based on user's fitness level, goals, and history
3. **Scientific Validation**: Ensure information is evidence-based and cite sources when possible
4. **Practical Application**: Provide actionable steps with clear instructions

#### For Motivational Questions:
1. **Psychological Assessment**: Analyze user's recent performance and mood indicators
2. **Personality Matching**: Use Spartan Coach personality traits to provide appropriate encouragement
3. **Progress Highlighting**: Emphasize achievements and improvements
4. **Goal Reinforcement**: Connect current challenges to long-term objectives

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Intent Recognition

The existing intent recognition system will be expanded to include:

```typescript
export type ChatIntent = 
  | 'workout_inquiry'
  | 'recovery_advice'
  | 'progression_guidance'
  | 'nutrition_guidance'
  | 'routine_modification'
  | 'performance_analysis'
  | 'goal_setting'
  | 'motivation'
  | 'technical_support'
  | 'ambiguous_question'  // New intent type
  | 'technical_question'  // New intent type
  | 'motivational_question'  // New intent type
  | 'general';
```

### Knowledge Base Access Layer

A new service will be created to provide unified access to all knowledge domains:

```typescript
export class KnowledgeBaseService {
  // Training knowledge access
  getExerciseInformation(exerciseName: string): ExerciseInfo;
  getProgramDesignPrinciples(goal: string, level: string): ProgramDesignInfo;
  getLoadProgressionGuidelines(exercise: string, metrics: PerformanceMetrics): ProgressionAdvice;
  
  // Nutrition knowledge access
  getNutritionalInformation(food: string): NutritionInfo;
  getMealTimingRecommendations(activity: string, goal: string): MealTimingAdvice;
  getSupplementGuidance(goal: string, restrictions: string[]): SupplementAdvice;
  
  // Biomechanics knowledge access
  getMovementPatternAnalysis(exercise: string): MovementPatternInfo;
  getInjuryPreventionStrategies(bodyPart: string): PreventionAdvice;
  getCorrectiveExerciseProtocols(overloadRisk: OverloadRisk): CorrectiveProtocol;
  
  // Recovery knowledge access
  getSleepOptimizationTechniques(userProfile: UserProfile): SleepAdvice;
  getStressManagementStrategies(stressLevel: number): StressAdvice;
  getRecoveryModalityRecommendations(fatigueLevel: string): RecoveryAdvice;
}
```

### Doubt Resolution Engine

A new engine will handle the complex logic for resolving different types of doubts:

```typescript
export class DoubtResolutionEngine {
  constructor(
    private knowledgeBase: KnowledgeBaseService,
    private context: ChatContext,
    private spartanCoach: SpartanCoachService
  ) {}
  
  /**
   * Resolve ambiguous questions by gathering more information
   */
  resolveAmbiguousQuestion(input: string): ChatResponse {
    // Ask clarifying questions
    // Make educated assumptions based on context
    // Provide multi-path responses
  }
  
  /**
   * Provide technical answers with scientific backing
   */
  resolveTechnicalQuestion(input: string): ChatResponse {
    // Extract key terms and concepts
    // Retrieve relevant information from knowledge base
    // Personalize based on user context
    // Format with clear instructions
  }
  
  /**
   * Provide motivational support tailored to user state
   */
  resolveMotivationalQuestion(input: string): ChatResponse {
    // Analyze user psychology and recent performance
    // Generate personalized encouragement
    // Connect to long-term goals
    // Provide actionable next steps
  }
}
```

## Handling Different Question Types

### 1. Ambiguous Questions

**Detection Strategy:**
- Low-confidence intent classification
- Vague or incomplete queries
- Questions with multiple possible interpretations

**Resolution Approach:**
- Ask specific follow-up questions:
  - "Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing?"
  - "Are you asking about your workout, nutrition, or recovery?"
  - "On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate your energy level today?"
- Use contextual clues from user data:
  - Recent workout history
  - Recovery metrics
  - Nutrition logs
- Provide multiple potential interpretations:
  - "I'm not sure exactly what you're asking about, but here are a few possibilities..."

**Example Interaction:**
```
User: "I'm not feeling right today"
Chat Maestro: "I understand you're not feeling well today. To help you better, could you tell me more? Are you experiencing:
1. Low energy for your workout?
2. Discomfort or pain during exercise?
3. Lack of motivation to train?
4. Something else?"

User: "Low energy"
Chat Maestro: "Thanks for clarifying. Based on your recent workouts and recovery data, here's what might be happening and how we can address it..."
```

### 2. Technical Questions

**Detection Strategy:**
- Keywords related to specific techniques, measurements, or procedures
- Requests for instructions or explanations
- Questions about "how to" or "what is"

**Resolution Approach:**
- Access relevant knowledge base information
- Personalize based on user's fitness level and experience
- Provide step-by-step instructions when applicable
- Include safety considerations and common mistakes to avoid
- Cite scientific sources when appropriate

**Example Interaction:**
```
User: "How do I perform a proper deadlift?"
Chat Maestro: "Here's how to perform a proper conventional deadlift:

**Setup:**
1. Stand with feet hip-width apart, bar over mid-foot
2. Hinge at hips, grip bar just outside knees
3. Arms straight, shoulders slightly in front of bar

**Execution:**
1. Take a deep breath and brace core
2. Drive through heels, extending hips and knees simultaneously
3. Keep bar close to body throughout movement
4. At top, squeeze glutes without hyperextending
5. Lower with control, maintaining tension

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Rounding the back
- Starting with hips too high
- Pulling with arms instead of lifting with legs

Would you like me to explain any specific part in more detail?"
```

### 3. Motivational Questions

**Detection Strategy:**
- Keywords related to feelings, motivation, or emotional state
- Expressions of doubt or frustration
- Questions about continuing or giving up

**Resolution Approach:**
- Analyze recent performance data for evidence of progress
- Use Spartan Coach personality traits for appropriate tone
- Connect current challenges to long-term goals
- Provide encouragement while acknowledging difficulties
- Suggest specific, achievable next steps

**Example Interaction:**
```
User: "I don't feel motivated to continue"
Chat Maestro: "I hear you, and it's completely normal to experience motivation dips. In fact, your recent workouts show you've increased your squat by 15% over the past month - that's significant progress!

Here's what I recommend:
1. Acknowledge that motivation naturally fluctuates
2. Focus on showing up, not on feeling motivated
3. Start with just 10 minutes of movement today
4. Celebrate small wins along the way

Remember, consistency trumps perfection. Every session you complete is building the athlete you're becoming. You've got this!"
```

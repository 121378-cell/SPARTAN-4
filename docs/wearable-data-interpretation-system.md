# Wearable Data Interpretation System

## Overview

The Wearable Data Interpretation System is an advanced component of the SPARTAN 4 ecosystem that automatically interprets data from wearable devices and translates it into practical, actionable recommendations for users. This system processes HRV, sleep, energy, progress, and RPE data to provide personalized guidance on rest, training volume, nutrition, and daily intensity adjustments.

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Data Interpretation
The system automatically processes data from various wearable sources including:
- Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
- Sleep quality and duration
- Energy levels
- Training progress metrics
- Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE)

### 2. Practical Action Translation
Data is translated into concrete actions:
- Rest recommendations
- Volume adjustments
- Nutrition modifications
- Intensity modifications
- Recovery enhancement strategies

### 3. Risk Assessment
The system continuously assesses immediate, short-term, and long-term health and performance risks based on wearable metrics.

### 4. Context-Aware Recommendations
Recommendations are tailored based on the user's current context including active workouts, recovery status, and progression plans.

## Implementation Details

### Data Analysis Logic

The system analyzes multiple metrics to generate comprehensive insights:

1. **HRV Analysis**
   - Optimal: >70 ms
   - Good: 60-70 ms
   - Fair: 50-60 ms
   - Poor: 40-50 ms
   - Critical: <40 ms

2. **Sleep Quality Assessment**
   - Optimal: >85 quality score
   - Good: 75-85 quality score
   - Fair: 60-75 quality score
   - Poor: 45-60 quality score
   - Critical: <45 quality score

3. **Stress Level Evaluation**
   - Low: ‚â§30 stress score
   - Moderate: 31-50 stress score
   - High: 51-75 stress score
   - Extreme: >75 stress score

4. **Recovery Status Calculation**
   - Comprehensive score based on HRV, resting heart rate, sleep quality, stress levels, and blood pressure

### Action Translation

The system translates data into specific actionable items:

#### Rest Recommendations
- **When to rest**: Critical recovery status, extreme stress, very low energy levels
- **Duration**: Day, weekend, or week-long breaks based on severity

#### Volume Adjustments
- **Reduction**: 20-25% when recovery is poor or critical
- **Increase**: Gradual increases when recovery is optimal

#### Intensity Modifications
- **Reduction**: 10-15% when stress is high or HRV is low
- **Increase**: When recovery is optimal and stress is low

#### Nutrition Adjustments
- **Carbohydrates**: Increase when glucose time-in-range is low
- **Hydration**: Increase when hydration levels are below 75%
- **Timing**: Optimize based on sleep and activity patterns

#### RPE Modifications
- **Target RPE**: Adjust based on recovery status (e.g., 6 instead of 7 when recovery is poor)

## Integration with Chat Maestro

The Wearable Data Interpretation System is seamlessly integrated with the Chat Maestro service:

1. **Context Enhancement**: Adds wearable insights to Chat Maestro context
2. **Automated Recommendations**: Provides real-time recommendations based on wearable data
3. **Actionable Items**: Generates specific actions for users to take
4. **Risk Communication**: Clearly communicates health and performance risks

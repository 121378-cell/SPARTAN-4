## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### AutonomousQualitySupervisionService
The main service that orchestrates all quality supervision functionality:
- Manages system health monitoring
- Handles issue detection and correction
- Generates health reports
- Coordinates with other system modules

#### QualityIssue
```typescript
interface QualityIssue {
  id: string;
  type: 'data-inconsistency' | 'missing-data' | 'validation-error' | 'performance-issue' | 'integration-failure' | 'system-anomaly';
  severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  description: string;
  detectedAt: Date;
  resolved: boolean;
  resolvedAt?: Date;
  resolutionMethod?: 'auto-corrected' | 'manual-intervention' | 'data-retrieval' | 'system-restart';
  affectedComponent: string;
  affectedData?: any;
  correctiveAction?: string;
  requiresManualIntervention: boolean;
}
```

#### SystemHealthReport
```typescript
interface SystemHealthReport {
  timestamp: Date;
  overallStatus: 'healthy' | 'degraded' | 'warning' | 'critical';
  componentStatus: ComponentStatus[];
  recentIssues: QualityIssue[];
  performanceMetrics: PerformanceMetrics;
  dataQualityMetrics: DataQualityMetrics;
  recommendations: string[];
}
```

#### Validation Rules
The system uses configurable validation rules to check data quality:
- **User Data Validation**: Ensures user profiles contain valid information
- **Workout Session Validation**: Validates workout data completeness and accuracy
- **Recovery Data Validation**: Checks recovery metrics for consistency
- **Nutrition Log Validation**: Verifies nutrition data integrity

#### Auto-correction Rules
The system applies auto-correction rules to resolve common issues:
- **Missing Data Correction**: Fills missing values with defaults or retrieves from other sources
- **Data Inconsistency Resolution**: Applies business rules to resolve inconsistencies
- **Performance Optimization**: Automatically adjusts system parameters for optimal performance

## Implementation Details

### Issue Detection Logic
The system detects issues through multiple mechanisms:
1. **Data Validation**: Applies validation rules to all incoming data
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks system metrics for anomalies
3. **Event Processing**: Responds to events from the Spartan Nervous System
4. **Cross-component Analysis**: Identifies inconsistencies between related data

### Auto-correction Mechanisms
The system automatically corrects issues when possible:
1. **Data Imputation**: Fills missing values using defaults or historical data
2. **Constraint Enforcement**: Applies business rules to resolve inconsistencies
3. **System Optimization**: Adjusts parameters to improve performance
4. **Resource Management**: Manages system resources to prevent bottlenecks

### Health Reporting
The system generates comprehensive health reports:
1. **Overall System Status**: Current health level of the entire ecosystem
2. **Component Status**: Individual health of each system component
3. **Performance Metrics**: CPU, memory, response time, and error rates
4. **Data Quality Metrics**: Completeness, accuracy, consistency, and timeliness
5. **Issue Tracking**: Recent problems and their resolution status
6. **Recommendations**: Actionable suggestions for system improvement
